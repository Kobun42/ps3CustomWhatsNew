# What's New - PS3
Nowadays, the "What's New" page on the PS3 has stayed stagnant. While I definitely understand why, I wanted to breathe some new life into it.
So, at risk of bricking my console, I edited a system SELF file... and I managed to replace the what's new server with that of my local webserver.

# How do I do this?
